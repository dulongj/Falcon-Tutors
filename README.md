# Falcon-Tutors
CS 460 Project

************************
Falcon-Tutors is a Swift built, iOS native app to allow Bentley University students to search for tutor center information based on courses they are currently enrolled in. <br><br>
The project was designed and created for the Bentley CS460 course and includes an Azure Framework dependency that will expire roughly 1/1/2017, at which time the app will no longer function properly. <br><br>
Due to the limitations of the Azure Framework the project is written in Swift 2.3, unable to be updated to Swift 3. <br>
